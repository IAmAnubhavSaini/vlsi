very lousy stack implementation; Network Stack Implementation to clear concepts about stack itself.

this code will implement OSI model. This decision is taken as TCP/IP model is specialization of OSI model, in a way. And since this is very lousy implementation by name, by definition it must be lousy too.


Thanks!
